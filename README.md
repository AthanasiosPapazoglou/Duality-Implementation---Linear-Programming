   This is a basic mathematical implementation of the Duality theory in Linear Programming
   -The entirety of the code is writen in C
   -Turns the given primal problem to its contradictory dual form
   -Valid for squared problems ( No. of Limitations = No. of Variables )
   -Size of the problem as set by default as 3, you can change it within the code #define N <Size>
