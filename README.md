   This is a basic mathematical implementation of the Duality theory.
   
   The Duality Theory is one of the fundamendal research subjects in Linear Programming and Operational Research.
   
   The entirety of this implementation is written and developed in C. 
   
   Turns the given primal problem to its contradictory dual form
   
   Valid for squared problems ( No. of Limitations = No. of Variables )
   
   Size of the problem is set by default as 3, you can change it within the code #define N <Size>
